<h3 style"color:yellow">ABOUT ME:</h3>
<pre>
I am an enthusiastic and driven BTech student with a solid foundation in technology and engineering.
 Over the course of my academic journey, Iâ€™ve gained a strong understanding of key concepts in computer science/engineering .
 My coursework has helped me build skills in areas such as programming languages like C, Java, Python, and web development.
 Additionally, I have hands-on experience with tools and platforms like Git, SQL, and various
 frameworks that are essential for real-world applications. 
I am constantly seeking to expand my knowledge, and I actively engage in various online courses and participate in hackathons and 
coding challenges to enhance my problem-solving abilities.

Along with my technical skills, I value teamwork and communication, having participated in group projects throughout my college life.
 I believe these experiences have taught me the importance of collaboration and how to handle responsibilities under deadlines. 
While I am still refining my skills in areas like machine learning, data structures, and algorithms, I am eager to learn and grow in the field. 
I am also passionate about working on real-time projects and gaining practical experience through internships and open-source contributions,
 where I can apply my learning and contribute to meaningful outcomes.
